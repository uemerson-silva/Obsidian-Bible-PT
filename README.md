# Obsidian-Bible-PT
Markdown file Bible in version NVI-PT to be used in Obsidian.

This is a Bible in Portuguese language version NVI-PT generated by the process mentioned on https://github.com/joebuhlig/BibleGateway-to-Obsidian (Some adaptations were done because it was not downloading the NVI-PT properly).

The file is splitted in verses, each verse is a file.md. That means you can reference a specific verse in Obsidian and it will appear as an outgoing link in your notes and also in the local graph. You can download the .zip file and add to your Obsidian Vault to start using it without scripts execution.
